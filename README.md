# GitObserve

[GitObserve](https://apaunchev.github.io/gitobserve) is a simple GitHub client that lets you track issues and pull requests across your [watched repositories](http://github.com/watching). It was born out of necessity to monitor pending work within a development team.

Implementaion inspired by [GitStar](https://github.com/GraphQLCollege/gitstar) and [Trailer](https://github.com/ptsochantaris/trailer).
